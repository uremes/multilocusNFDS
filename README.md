# Negative frequency-dependent selection in post-vaccine pneumococcal population

This repository contains resources to replicate the parameter inference experiments reported by Corander et al. [1]. 
The inference procedure is implemented with ELFI [2].

The codes have been tested with Python 3.5 and ELFI v. 0.7.4.

## Files and folders

- **code/**
  This folder contains the simulator and utilities for parameter inference with ELFI.
- **data/**
  This folder contains the observed data.
